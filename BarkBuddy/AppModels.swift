// ***Notes for Users class***
// in a file holding functions for the app (or maybe we just have one purely for our firebase related functions?), we need to have a function that creates a user from firebase
// We'll probably want a pet class? Connect it to owner with the owner's ID maybe?
// We might want to add a variable to keep track of who our current user is

// separate class for Walkers, they do different duties in the app so it should make sense?
