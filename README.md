# BarkBuddy

BarkBuddy is a rideshare style app for dog walking. The app is a platform app as it connects dog walkers to dog owners based on user reviews and location. The goal of this app is to make dog walking for both dog owners and dog walkers. The app will recommend highly rated, local walkers to pet owners and the dog walkers will have their services shown to dog owners.
